Clients Keeper App
=

This is a simple clients keeper app. It is one of the project from Udemy course, Projects in ExpressJS - Learn ExpressJS building 10 projects. It is a MEAN stack development (Mongo-Express-Angular5-Node). 

What can be learnt from the course
- Backend REST API
- MongoJS ORM/ODM
- Angular 2 Frontend
- Components, Services, HTTP Module
- Separate Frontend / Backend

What I have done when going through the course
- Combined frontend and backend components in the same project folder.
- Modified script to build Angular files and start Node server in a single command.
- Use Angular Material for the UI layout (mat-table, mat-pagination, matSort).
- Use Angular 5 latest feature, HttpClient.
- Use Reactive Form technique to create form in Angular.
- Customise filter function to search for filter value in all document fields in mongodb. Not able to use Text Search feature in mongodb to filter the document.
- Extend datasource to customise the data source for pagination
- Implement callback in filterClient function in NodeJS to achieve DRY.

- At terminal (mac), $ npm run build
